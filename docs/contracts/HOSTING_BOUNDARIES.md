# Hosting Boundaries Contract

## Public boundary

- Cloudflare Workers is the only deployment plane for this repository.
- GitHub is a source-control and validation plane only. Repository automation
  MUST NOT create GitHub Deployments or GitHub Environments, and pull requests
  MUST NOT request deployment to a GitHub environment.
- Public visitors read remote dashboard state and never connect to localhost.
- Public API reads may be anonymous, but every ingest route requires the Worker
  secret `INGEST_TOKEN`.
- Local secrets remain outside Git and must not appear in public responses or
  logs.
- The ChatGPT Sites bypass header may be sent only to `*.chatgpt.site`; it must
  never be forwarded to Cloudflare or another target.

## Target isolation

- Each hosting target has independent synchronization state and health.
- Failure of one target must not stop synchronization to the other target.
- If both targets reject the heartbeat, synchronization must expose an error.
- Public-hosting failure must not stop local evidence collection.
- Optional growing resources, such as news details, must not mark an otherwise
  current live heartbeat offline.

Preview-specific write isolation and provenance guarantees are defined in
[`PREVIEW_ISOLATION.md`](PREVIEW_ISOLATION.md).
